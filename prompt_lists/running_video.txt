A full shot of seven cute toy-like characters lined up at the start line of a park running track. 
They look excited, some stretching arms, others smiling. 
The camera pulls back slowly as the whistle blows and they all start running together in sync. 
Bright morning sunlight, energetic atmosphere.


The same group of characters is now running side by side on the track. 
Their arms and legs move rhythmically, with bouncing steps. 
One character drinks from a juice box while running playfully, others encourage each other. 
The camera tracks forward smoothly, keeping all characters in frame. 
Background shows trees and cheering crowd.


The group speeds up, running with determination and bigger strides. 
Sweat drops and joyful expressions emphasize their effort. 
One character briefly trips but friends help and keep running together. 
The camera pans alongside them at low angle, showing speed and unity. 
Sunlight flares through the trees, dynamic motion.


The group dashes toward the finish line together, still smiling. 
They cross the line almost at the same time, raising hands in celebration. 
Confetti and bright lights appear, the camera zooms out to show the whole group cheering and hugging. 
The scene ends with them standing proudly, posing with victory signs.
