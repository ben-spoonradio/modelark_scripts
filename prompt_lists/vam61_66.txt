16-year-old Quinn with curly black hair reaches to remove the glass shard from the top of the mysterious red book with his bleeding thumb. As he carefully lifts the piece of glass, a single drop of bright red blood falls from his cut thumb and lands directly on the center of the ancient tome. The blood makes contact with the jawbone design on the cover. Time seems to slow as this pivotal moment unfolds in the warm apartment lighting.
